For the brave pilots of the Aetherion, defending humanity against the Xerath Dominion.


1 Backstory: The Nebula Sector Conflict


1.1 Prologue: A Galaxy in Peril


In the year 2478, humanity stands on the brink of extinction. Having colonized distant
star systems, the United Earth Coalition (UEC) thrived in the Nebula Sector, a vibrant region
of swirling cosmic clouds and resource-rich planets. The sector’s prosperity, however,
drew the attention of the Xerath Dominion, a ruthless alien empire driven by an
insatiable hunger for conquest. Led by the enigmatic Overlord Zykar, the Dominion
unleashed a devastating assault, obliterating UEC outposts and enslaving entire worlds.

Their ultimate weapon, The Oblivion, a colossal warship capable of annihilating stars,
looms as a harbinger of doom. Amid the chaos, a glimmer of hope emerges: the Aetherion, an 
experimental starfighter equipped with advanced weaponry and unmatched agility. Piloted by
Commander Aria Vex, a decorated war hero with an unyielding spirit, the Aetherion is humanity’s 
last stand against the Dominion’s tyranny. As the Nebula Sector burns, Aria embarks on a
perilous mission to repel the invaders, destroy The Oblivion, and uncover the Dominion’s
dark secrets.


1.2 The Rise of Commander Aria Vex


Born on the mining colony of Elara-7, Aria Vex grew up amidst the harsh realities of
frontier life. Her parents, scientists working on experimental propulsion systems, instilled
in her a passion for technology and a fierce determination. When the Dominion
attacked Elara-7, Aria, then only 16, piloted a salvaged shuttle to evacuate survivors,
earning her a place in the UEC Academy. Her natural talent and fearless resolve saw
her rise through the ranks, culminating in her assignment to the Aetherion Project.
Haunted by the loss of her home and driven by a vow to protect humanity, Aria is both
a warrior and a symbol of resistance. Her mission is not just to fight but to unravel the
Dominion’s motives—rumors whisper of an ancient artifact, the Starheart, hidden in
the Nebula Sector, capable of reshaping reality itself. As Aria battles through waves of
enemies, she must confront her past, forge alliances with unlikely allies, and decide the
fate of the galaxy.


1.3 The Xerath Dominion


The Xerath Dominion is a militaristic empire of biomechanical beings, their origins shrouded
in mystery. Once a peaceful civilization, the Xerath were corrupted by their discovery of
the Void Nexus, a dimension of raw, destructive energy. Fusing their biology with Void
technology, they became a hive-mind collective, fanatically devoted to Overlord Zykar.
Their forces include agile fighters, hulking tanks, and specialized units like the Leech
and Artillery drones, all designed to overwhelm and subjugate.
The Dominion’s goal is not mere conquest but the assimilation of all sentient life into
their collective. The Oblivion, their flagship, is a testament to their power, capable of
deploying devastating weaponry and spawning endless waves of drones. Yet, whispers
among defectors suggest Zykar seeks the Starheart to transcend the Void Nexus, becoming
a god-like entity. Aria’s mission is to stop this apocalyptic ambition before it consumes
the galaxy.


1.4 Your Mission


As Commander Aria Vex, you pilot the Aetherion through the treacherous Nebula Sector.
Your objectives are clear:

• Survive Waves of Enemies: Battle through increasingly difficult waves of Dominion
forces, from standard fighters to specialized drones.

among the stars.

4 Gameplay Mechanics


Star Fighter combines fast-paced action with strategic elements. Understanding the mechanics
is key to surviving the Nebula Sector.


4.1 Objective


Navigate through waves of enemies in each level, culminating in a boss fight. Defeat
the boss to advance to the next level. Collect power-ups to enhance your capabilities
and earn points to climb the high score leaderboard. If your health reaches zero, you
lose a life; lose all lives, and the game ends, prompting a high score entry if your score
qualifies.


4.2 Health and Lives


• Health: The Aetherion starts with 100 health points, displayed as a bar at the topleft.
Damage from enemies, bullets, bombs, or asteroids reduces health. If health
reaches zero, you lose a life.

• Lives: You begin with 3 lives, shown as heart icons. Losing a life resets your position
and health but clears enemies. Losing all lives triggers a game over.

• Invincibility: After losing a life, you’re temporarily invincible (3 seconds), blinking
to indicate immunity.


4.3 Waves and Levels


• Waves: Each level consists of 6–10 waves, increasing in enemy count and difficulty.
Waves 1–5 spawn standard enemies; wave 6 introduces a boss.

• Levels: Completing a boss fight advances you to the next level, with more enemies,
faster spawns, and tougher bosses. Levels feature new backgrounds and increased
asteroid hazards (from level 2).

• Scoring: Destroy enemies to earn points (e.g., standard enemies: 10–20 points,
bosses: 250+ points, scaled by level). Completing a level grants a 100-point bonus.


4.4 Power-Ups


Power-ups drop randomly from destroyed enemies and last 15 seconds (except bombs).
They include:
• Health Pack: Restores 25 health points (up to 100).
• Double Shot: Fires two bullets simultaneously, increasing firepower.
• Shield: Grants temporary immunity to damage, displayed as a blue aura.
• Missile: Enables homing missiles (fired with ‘M’), which seek enemies or asteroids.
• Speed Boost: Increases movement speed by 50%.
• Bomb: Grants a bomb (up to 9), which clears all enemies and projectiles when used
(‘B’).
Power-up timers are shown on the right side of the screen with colored bars (e.g., yellow
for double shot, blue for shield).


4.5 Asteroids


From level 2, asteroids appear as obstacles, moving diagonally downward. They deal 15
damage to the Aetherion or enemies on collision and require multiple hits to destroy (3
for bullets, 1 for missiles). Bombs instantly clear all asteroids.


4.6 Game Over and High Scores


When all lives are lost, the game ends, displaying your final score. If your score ranks
among the top 5 or there are fewer than 5 scores, enter your 3-letter initials for the
leaderboard. High scores are saved to high_scores.txt and viewable in the main
menu.
